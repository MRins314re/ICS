#Any text that is green and contained with a '#' symbol is a comment and will be ignored when the program is ran
#The first command we are learning in this course is called "print". 
#The first use of print will be to print strings. 
#Inside the parenthesis and quotation marks below type the text Hello World!
print("Hello World!")
#Now hit f5 to run this program.
#When you see it successfully run in the terminal delete all comments and rename the file to helloWorld
#Then you will submit the .py file as your first assessment!
